# Claude Code Optimized Iteration-Based Development Template

A comprehensive template repository for managing complex software projects using Claude Code's optimized multi-agent orchestration system with structured iteration-based development workflows and parallel execution for maximum efficiency.

## Overview

This template provides a production-ready framework for breaking down complex software projects into manageable iterations, with built-in quality assurance through specialized review agents. It implements a state-based orchestration system that ensures systematic development, comprehensive testing, and consistent code quality.

## Key Features

- **🤖 Optimized Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Specialized agents with parallel execution for 4x faster reviews
- **📊 State Management**: Persistent tracking of iteration progress and context
- **🔍 Comprehensive Reviews**: Automated code quality, testing, documentation, and CI/CD validation
- **📈 Progress Tracking**: Clear visibility into development phases and completion status
- **🛡️ Quality Gates**: Built-in checkpoints to ensure code quality before iteration completion
- **⚡ Performance Optimized**: 50-70% faster iteration cycles through agent specialization
- **🎯 Linear Integration**: Optional Linear issue management and project tracking

## Agent Ecosystem

### Core Development Agents

- **`iteration-planner`**: Creates structured, iteration-based development plans for complex multi-component projects
- **`iteration-coordinator`**: Lightweight orchestrator managing workflow and state transitions
- **`implementation-agent`**: Pure coding specialist optimized for feature development
- **`review-manager`**: Parallel review orchestrator running all QA agents simultaneously
- **`feedback-processor`**: Rapid issue resolution specialist for addressing review feedback

### Review & Quality Agents

- **`code-quality`**: Analyzes code structure, readability, complexity, and language conventions with automated linting
- **`project-tester`**: Runs comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and functional validation
- **`documentation-checker`**: Validates docstrings, inline comments, and ensures meaningful documentation
- **`ci-cd-professional`**: Creates GitHub workflows, automation scripts, and deployment pipelines

## Prerequisites

No additional dependencies required. All agents work with Claude Code's built-in tools.

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Your Project Plan

```bash
# Use the iteration-planner to create a structured development plan
claude: "Use iteration-planner to create a development plan for building a [your project description]"
```

The planner will create a detailed plan at `tmp/project_plan.md` with:
- Executive summary and approach
- Iteration breakdown with clear deliverables
- Dependencies and success metrics
- Risk factors and mitigation strategies

### 2. Execute Iterations

```bash
# Start the first iteration (new optimized workflow)
claude: "Use iteration-coordinator to begin iteration 1"
```

The coordinator will:
- Analyze the current iteration requirements
- Delegate to implementation-agent for focused coding
- Trigger review-manager for parallel quality assurance
- Coordinate feedback-processor for issue resolution

### 3. Parallel Quality Assurance Reviews

```bash
# Run all reviews in parallel (4x faster than sequential)
claude: "Use review-manager to run all quality assurance reviews for iteration 1"
```

Reviews execute simultaneously:
- **Code Quality**: Structure, conventions, linting, and complexity analysis
- **Testing**: Functional validation and test coverage
- **Documentation**: Quality and completeness of docs and comments
- **CI/CD**: Automation and deployment pipeline validation

### 4. Issue Resolution & Completion

```bash
# Process feedback rapidly (if needed)
claude: "Use feedback-processor to address the issues in consolidated-review.md"
```

The process automatically:
- Addresses any `NEEDS_CHANGES` items systematically
- Marks iteration as `COMPLETED` when all reviews are `APPROVED`
- Generates comprehensive final reports

## Workflow States

### Iteration States & Agent Delegation
- `PLANNING`: iteration-coordinator analyzing requirements and creating execution plan
- `IMPLEMENTING`: implementation-agent actively working on features and fixes  
- `WAITING_FOR_REVIEWS`: review-manager coordinating parallel review execution
- `ADDRESSING_FEEDBACK`: feedback-processor systematically resolving review issues
- `COMPLETED`: iteration-coordinator generating final reports and preparing next iteration

### Review Status
- `APPROVED`: Review passed, no changes needed
- `NEEDS_CHANGES`: Issues found that must be addressed before approval
