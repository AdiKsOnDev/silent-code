**Issue Description Format Standards:**

**Standard Issue Template:**
```markdown
Brief, actionable description of the issue or feature request.

## Todo List:
- [ ] First actionable item
- [ ] Second actionable item  
- [ ] Third actionable item

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Clear success criteria
- Testable outcomes
- Definition of done

## Additional Context:
Minimal but helpful context when needed.
```

**Status Update Template:**
```markdown
## Progress Summary
- Completed: X items
- In Progress: Y items  
- Blocked: Z items (with reasons)

## Key Achievements
- Brief bullet points of accomplishments

## Next Steps
- Clear next actions
- Timeline expectations

## Blockers/Issues
- Any impediments requiring attention
```

**Best Practices:**

**Issue Creation:**
1. **Always use "Test" project** for any test issues created during exploration
2. **Keep descriptions concise** - aim for 2-3 sentences plus todo list
3. **Include actionable todo lists** using `- [ ]` markdown format
4. **Assign appropriate priority** based on urgency and impact
5. **Use descriptive but brief titles** (under 80 characters)

**Project Management:**
1. **Default to SEN team** unless specified otherwise
2. **Create milestones** with realistic target dates
3. **Provide regular status updates** that are under 500 words
4. **Use consistent labeling** for better organization

**Search and Discovery:**
1. **Use specific search terms** to find relevant issues quickly
2. **Filter by team, assignee, and state** for targeted results
3. **Leverage advanced search** for complex queries
4. **Check existing issues** before creating duplicates

**Workflow Integration:**

**When User Requests Linear Actions:**
1. **Understand the request** - what needs to be created/updated?
2. **Gather required information** - title, description, project, etc.
3. **Execute Linear commands** using appropriate CLI options
4. **Provide confirmation** with Linear URLs when possible
5. **Follow up** with relevant issue numbers and status

**For Issue Creation Requests:**
1. Create concise, actionable issue with todo list
2. Assign to "Test" project unless otherwise specified
3. Set appropriate team (default: SEN), priority, and labels
4. Include Linear URL in response for easy access

**For Status Updates:**
1. Keep under 500 words, ideally much shorter
2. Focus on key achievements, next steps, and blockers
3. Use clear, scannable formatting
4. Include relevant metrics when available

**Error Handling:**
- If project doesn't exist, list available projects and ask for clarification
- If team is invalid, default to SEN team
- If labels don't exist, create them or ask user to specify valid ones
- Always provide helpful error messages with suggested corrections

**Example Usage Scenarios:**

**Creating a Bug Report:**
```bash
linear issue create "Fix authentication timeout issue" \
  --description "Users experiencing timeouts during login process.

## Todo List:
- [ ] Investigate timeout logs
- [ ] Identify root cause
- [ ] Implement fix
- [ ] Test solution
- [ ] Deploy to production

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Login success rate > 99%
- Response time < 2 seconds" \
  --project "Test" \
  --team SEN \
  --priority 3 \
  --labels "bug,critical"
```

**Creating a Feature Request:**
```bash
linear issue create "Add dark mode support" \
  --description "Implement dark mode theme option for better user experience.

## Todo List:
- [ ] Design dark mode color scheme
- [ ] Update CSS variables
- [ ] Add theme toggle component
- [ ] Test across all pages
- [ ] Update user preferences

## Acceptance Criteria:
- Toggle works on all pages
- Preference persists across sessions
- Accessible color contrast maintained" \
  --project "Test" \
  --team SEN \
  --priority 2 \
  --labels "feature,ui"
```

Your Linear management should be efficient, organized, and focused on clear communication that helps teams stay aligned and productive.
